            Having finished my degree in Biology at FCUP, I'm looking forward to develop software development skills in the future.<br />
            I'm currently the Coordinator of the Recreational and Cultural Department of the University of Porto Biology Students' Group (NEBUP), leading a team of 14 people. <br />
            I've been a member of FCUP's university volleyball team since September 2021 and I'm also particularly interested in writing poems, having published my first book "Horas Tardias" in May last year. <br />
